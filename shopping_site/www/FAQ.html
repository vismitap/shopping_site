            <h3>FAQ</h3>
        
           <b> 1. What is the specialty of wearing Babu Fashion cotton Tshirt?</b>
           <br><br>
            Cotton is a ‘natural’ fibre, which means it is not derived using chemicals. <br>
            For someone with sensitive skin, or for children, polyester might be an irritant and cause chafing of the skin. <br>
            Mercerised cotton on the other hand is softer and more absorbent, resulting in lesser to no irritation of the skin. <br>
            This is especially important when choosing your garments. <br>
            Our 100% cotton Shirts, T-Shirts & socks are very light and soft on your skin, and won’t make your body sweat in normal conditions unlike the polyester garments. 
            <br>While the fit is important, choosing the right material goes a long way in ensuring extra comfort.
            <br> Mercerisation also makes the product lustrous and soft adding not only comfort but luxury to your feet. 
            <br>Mercerised cotton products also stand the tests of time and several washes, and will make your Apparels fit and look almost as good as new over a long period of time.
            
          <br><br>  <b>2. How many washes do our products last?</b>
            <br><br>
            Babu Fashion products are manufactured to last many washes. All Babu Fashion products should be washed and dried inside out to make them last longer.

            <br><br> <b>3. I have forgotten my password. How can I get into my account?</b>

            <br> <br> <b>4. How can I view previous orders I have placed?</b>
              <br><br>
              Once you log in, under “My Account” section go to “My Orders” where you can view all of your past orders.
